## Introduction

Firefly-AI is a senior design project focused on utilizing machine learning to understand and predict firefly behavior. This repository hosts the code and data used in the development of the project.

## Files

- `Thermoflyai_lstm_testing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for testing the trained LSTM model on firefly behavior data.
- `Thermoflyai_model_training.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training the LSTM model using the provided data.
- `TinkerGUI.py`: Python script for a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the trained model.
- `raw_data.csv`: Raw firefly behavior data in CSV format.
- `raw_data.txt`: Raw firefly behavior data in text format.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Firefly-AI.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Firefly-AI`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Use the provided Jupyter Notebooks for model training and testing.
5. Run the `TinkerGUI.py` script to interact with the trained model using the GUI.

## Notebooks

- `Thermoflyai_lstm_testing.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates how to load the trained LSTM model and perform predictions on new data.
- `Thermoflyai_model_training.ipynb`: This notebook details the process of preprocessing the data and training the LSTM model.

## Data

The `raw_data.csv` and `raw_data.txt` files contain the raw data used for training and testing the model. Make sure to preprocess the data before using it for training.
