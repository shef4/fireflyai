Introduction
Firefly-AI is a senior design project focused on utilizing machine learning to understand and predict the ideal HVAC system temperature for users. This repository hosts the code and data used in the development of the project.

Files
Thermoflyai_lstm_testing.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for testing the trained LSTM model on user temperature preference data.
Thermoflyai_model_training.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training the LSTM model using the provided data.
TinkerGUI.py: Python script for a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the trained model.
raw_data.csv: Raw HVAC user preference data in CSV format.
raw_data.txt: Raw HVAC user preference data in text format.
Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Firefly-AI.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd Firefly-AI
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Use the provided Jupyter Notebooks for model training and testing.
Run the TinkerGUI.py script to interact with the trained model using the GUI.
Notebooks
Thermoflyai_lstm_testing.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates how to load the trained LSTM model and perform predictions on new data.
Thermoflyai_model_training.ipynb: This notebook details the process of preprocessing the data and training the LSTM model.
Data
The raw_data.csv and raw_data.txt files contain the raw data used for training and testing the model. Make sure to preprocess the data before using it for training.
